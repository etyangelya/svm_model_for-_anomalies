# svm_model_for-_anomalies
This project focuses on using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for traffic analysis. The primary objective is to classify and predict traffic patterns based on various input features such as vehicle count, speed, and time of day..
Key Features:

Data Processing: Preprocessing traffic data to handle missing values, normalize features, and enhance model performance.

Feature Engineering: Selecting relevant features such as traffic density, weather conditions, and time-based patterns to improve classification accuracy.

Model Training: Implementing and training an SVM model on historical traffic data.

Evaluation Metrics: Using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance.

Visualization: Generating graphs and heatmaps to illustrate traffic trends and model predictions.

Technologies Used:

Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Scikit-learn for machine learning implementation

Jupyter Notebook for development and experimentation

Potential Applications:

Traffic congestion prediction

Intelligent transportation systems

Real-time traffic monitoring

This project provides insights into traffic flow patterns, enabling better urban planning and smart city initiatives.
